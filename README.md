# hello-world
my first repository

I look forward to expanding my knowledge in coding and programming.  I have an interest in technology applications and how they positively impact human lives and organizations.  Therefore, I am currently learning how to be a data architect, data scientist, and cloud architect via AWS Educate.  As a military member, I know I have gaps in knowledge and experience in this realm.  However, I'm confident that with enough humility, grit, gumption, and support I can bridge those gaps.  

I'm a lifelong learner and I'm eager to learn.  Please feel free to provide any candid feedback.  I have military 'thick skin'.  :)
